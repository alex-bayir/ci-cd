# This is a basic workflow to help you get started with Actions

name: CI

# Controls when the workflow will run
on:
  # Triggers the workflow on push or pull request events but only for the "main" branch
  push:
    branches: [ "main" ]
    tags:
      - 'v*' # Push events to matching v*, i.e. v1.0, v20.15.10
